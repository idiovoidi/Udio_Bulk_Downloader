  UDIO LIBRARY MAPPER - CHROME EXTENSION
  Installation Instructions
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: You need to select THIS FOLDER (chrome_extension) when loading!

STEP-BY-STEP:

1. Open Chrome and go to:
   chrome://extensions/

2. Turn ON "Developer mode" 
   (Toggle switch in the TOP RIGHT corner)

3. Click "Load unpacked" button
   (Top left, near the search bar)

4. In the file browser that opens:
   - Navigate to your project folder
   - SELECT THE "chrome_extension" FOLDER
   - NOT the parent folder!
   - NOT the "udio_downloader" folder!
   
   The correct path should end with:
   .../Udio_Bulk_Downloader/chrome_extension

5. Click "Select Folder"

6. You should see "Udio Library Mapper" appear in your extensions list

================================================================================

COMMON MISTAKE:
❌ Selecting the parent folder (Udio_Bulk_Downloader)
✅ Select the chrome_extension folder specifically

If you see an error about "__init__.py", you selected the wrong folder!

================================================================================
